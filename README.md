# Instagram: the replica of Instagram login page (with user)

I used my own Instagram homepage as a layout reference, showing my login that was saved on machine, logged out.

### Purpose

> Create a responsive landing page of Instagram homepage.

The original project belongs to [Gabriela Pinheiro](https://github.com/SpruceGabriela) and was provided by Digital Innovation One.

The reference Gabriela uses is her own Instagram responsive landing homepage, with some specific differences between the original and the false page just a bit noticeable.

### [InstaClone version](http://www.github.com/gabriellatri/instaclone)

> Look-alike Instagram landing homepage without using any kind of framework, only HTML5 and CSS3 in the most basic commands and functions.

Some differences are noticeable because of the original formatting variances. The page has only one script (jQuery) for the image of a smartphone with a slide of screens of the device app. Any other resources are being used. This version tries to create an identical landing page and it's very experimental, without any clean code principle. Just for fun :smile:
